# Cahrt.js

## How I install 

1. Found it on [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)
2. I opened [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) to getting started.
3. Install all plugins needed for chart.js.

``` 
npm install chart.js
```

### problem and solve

- I had issues about **npm install chart.js**

when I type npm install **chart.js** and they give me 0 varnable and nothing showes up. I asked help for Tony and he gave me key to try this: 

```
pwd
ls
npm init 
npm install chart.js
```
 and than all chart.js pakages are downloaded.Also, I tried to do diffrent chart style but looks like I had some problems on JavaScript.
